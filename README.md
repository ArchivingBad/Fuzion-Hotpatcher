# 1 VAC Ban On Record

This happened on the 6/6/17 to AimTux, Inuria, Chods etc. users. This fork of AimTux-Fuzion changes the Injector from the GNU Debugger (which is _unconfirmed_ detected) to Hotpatcher (which is undetected at the time of writing this). Please keep in mind that I don't have experience with C(++) or CMake/Make. The code edited by me is most likely bad written and shouldn't be used as good example, but **it works**.

This version of Fuzion requires the `hotpatch` dependency.  
You can install it on Arch with the following command:
```bash
$ yaourt -S hotpatch # Make sure you have yaourt & AUR enabled
```

For all other distros that don't have a community package available, install it from the [Hotpatcher source code](https://github.com/vikasnkumar/hotpatch).

The rest of downloading and installation is the same like the original AimTux Fuzion.  
  
This has been tested with a **brand new account** on both **VAC-secured official Casual & Matchmaking server(s)** and [the account](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198393440661/) **didn't receive a untrusted ban**. The account will atleast play 2 games per day with this fork, so if it gets banned, this fork is _detected_.

# Important

`uload` and `rload` have been disabled by my because I'm not sure how to unload/reload AimTux with HotPatcher. Just close CS:GO (and reopen it) to unload/reload.  
  
Hotpatcher can be detected like every other injector by VAC. **Please don't make this repository to known** and don't fork, copy or star it.
The expected detection time is ~1 month. **Don't submit this repository or forks of commits of this repository as Pull Request to Fuzion, AimTuxOfficial and bigger AimTux Forks.**.
Well, I can't stop you but its for your own sake of not getting detected.

# Other injectors

**I don't suggest buying other injectors** because:

1. You're buying a injector for a free cheat
2. Nobody knows if its really GDB that got detected
3. Your paid injector can also be detected at anytime
